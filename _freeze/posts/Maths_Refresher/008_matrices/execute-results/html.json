  $A = \\begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} & a_{14} \\\\ a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} & a_{24} \\\\ a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33} & a_{34} \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\n    -   $A$ is a $3\\times  4$ matrix that has $3$ rows and $4$ columns.\n\n    -   The element $a_{23}$ is located in the second row and the third column.\n\n-   If the matrix has one row (dimensions $1\\times  n$), it is referred to as `row matrix,`for example: $A = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 0 & 5 & 9 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\n-   If the matrix has one column (dimensions $m\\times  1$), it is referred to as `column matrix,`for example: $A = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 5 \\\\ 9 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\n-   In R, matrices can be created using the function `matrix()`:\n\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    A <- matrix(c(2, 0, 5, 9),  # element values\n                nrow = 2,       # specify the number of rows\n                byrow = TRUE)   # fill the matrix by rows\n    A\n    ```\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n    \n    ```\n         [,1] [,2]\n    [1,]    2    0\n    [2,]    5    9\n    ```\n    \n    \n    :::\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    # Any element can be extracted using the row and column index, For example, the element in the second row and first column (5) can be extracted from the matrix A as follows\n    \n    A[2, 1]\n    ```\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n    \n    ```\n    [1] 5\n    ```\n    \n    \n    :::\n    :::\n\n\n\n### Transpose of a matrix\n\n-   For a matrix $A$ with dimensions $m\\times  n$, the transpose of $A$, denoted as $A^T$ or $A'$, is a matrix with dimensions $n\\times  m$ formed by interchanging the rows and columns of $A$ (i.e., the rows of $A$ become the columns of $A^T$, and the columns of $A$ become the rows of $A^T$).\n\n-   Example:\n\n    -   $A = \\begin{bmatrix} \\color{red} 3 & \\color{#0466c8} 8 & \\color{green} 4 \\\\ \\color{red} 5 & \\color{#0466c8} 7 & \\color{green} 6 \\end{bmatrix} \\Rightarrow A^T = \\begin{bmatrix} \\color{red} 3 & \\color{red}5 \\\\ \\color{#0466c8}8 & \\color{#0466c8}7 \\\\ \\color{green}4 & \\color{green}6 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\n-   R can be used to get the transpose of a matrix using the function `t()`:\n\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    A <- matrix(c(3, 8, 4, 5, 7, 6), \n                nrow = 2, \n                byrow = TRUE)\n    A\n    ```\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n    \n    ```\n         [,1] [,2] [,3]\n    [1,]    3    8    4\n    [2,]    5    7    6\n    ```\n    \n    \n    :::\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    # get the transpose of the matrix A\n    t(A) \n    ```\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n    \n    ```\n         [,1] [,2]\n    [1,]    3    5\n    [2,]    8    7\n    [3,]    4    6\n    ```\n    \n    \n    :::\n    :::\n\n\n\n-   Some properties of the transpose of a matrix:\n\n    -   $(A^T)^T = A$.\n\n    -   $(A + B)^T = A^T + B^T$, where $A$ and $B$ are matrices of the same dimensions.\n\n    -   $(cA)^T = cA^T$, where $c$ is a scalar (constant).\n\n## Special types of matrices\n\n### Zero matrix\n\n-   It is a matrix having all of its elements equal to zero, for example: $A = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0  \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\n### Square matrix\n\n-   A `square matrix` has equal number of rows and columns (i.e., $m = n$).\n\n-   The `diagonal` consists of the elements running from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the matrix.\n\n-   The `trace` of a square matrix is the sum of the elements of the matrix `diagonal`.\n\n-   Elements other than the `diagonal` are termed `off-diagonal`.\n\n-   Example:\n\n    -   $A = \\begin{bmatrix} \\color{red} {5} & 9 & 4 & 15 \\\\ 2 & \\color{red} {6} & 3 & 9 \\\\ 1 & 4 & \\color{red} {11} & 21 \\\\ 10 & 17 & 12 & \\color{red} {8} \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\n    -   The `diagonal` consists of the elements $5, 6, 11$ and $8$.\n\n    -   The `trace` $= 5+6+11+8 = 30$\n\n    -   The diagonal elements can be extracted from a matrix in R using the function `diag()`:\n\n\n\n        ::: {.cell}\n        \n        ```{.r .cell-code}\n        A <- matrix(c(5, 9, 4, 15, 2, 6, 3, 9, 1, 4, 11, 21, 10, 17, 12, 8), \n                    nrow = 4, \n                    byrow = TRUE)\n        A\n        ```\n        \n        ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n        \n        ```\n             [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]\n        [1,]    5    9    4   15\n        [2,]    2    6    3    9\n        [3,]    1    4   11   21\n        [4,]   10   17   12    8\n        ```\n        \n        \n        :::\n        \n        ```{.r .cell-code}\n        diag(A)  # get the diagonal elements of the matrix A\n        ```\n        \n        ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n        \n        ```\n        [1]  5  6 11  8\n        ```\n        \n        \n        :::\n        :::\n\n\n\n    -

  If $A^T = A$, matrix $A$ is referred to as `symmetric`.\n\n    -   If $A^T = -A$, matrix $A$ is referred to as `skew-symmetric`.\n\n### Diagonal matrix\n\n-   It is a square matrix where all `off-diagonal` elements are zeros, for example: $B = \\begin{bmatrix} \\color{red} {5} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\color{red} {6} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\color{red} {11} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \\color{red} {8} \\end{bmatrix}$\n\n### Identity matrix\n\n-   It is a diagonal matrix where all the `diagonal` elements are equal to 1, e.g., $I_3 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\n-   In linear algebra, the identity matrix functions like the unit scalar of 1 in ordinary scalar algebra:\n\n    -   If a square matrix $A$ with dimensions $n\\times  n$ is multiplied by the identity matrix $I_n$, the result is the matrix $A$ itself (i.e., $A \\times I_n = I_n \\times A = A$).\n\n### Invertible matrix\n\n-   A square matrix $A$ with dimensions $n\\times  n$ is `invertible`, if there exists another matrix $B$ with the same dimensions $n\\times  n$ , such that, $AB = BA = I_n$, where $I_n$ is an identity matrix with dimensions $n\\times  n$.\n\n-   The inverse of a matrix $A$ is denoted by $A^{-1}$.\n\n-   An `invertible` matrix is also referred to as `non-singular` matrix.\n\n-   Invertible matrices have non-zero `determinant`:\n\n    -   The `determinant` of a matrix is a scalar value (i.e., a single numerical value) used when solving systems of linear equations or calculating the inverse of a matrix.\n\n    -   For a $2 \\times 2$ matrix $A = \\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{bmatrix}$, the `determinant`, denoted by $|A|$ or $det(A)$, is calculated as:\n\n        -   $|A| = ad - bc$.\n\n        -   For example, if $A = \\begin{bmatrix} 4 & 7 \\\\ 2 & 6 \\end{bmatrix} \\Rightarrow |A| = 4 \\times 6 - 7 \\times 2 = 24-14 = 10$.\n\n        -   The `determinant` and the `inverse` of a matrix can be calculated in R using the functions `det()` and `solve(),` respectively:\n\n\n\n            ::: {.cell}\n            \n            ```{.r .cell-code}\n            A <- matrix(c(4, 7, 2, 6), \n                        nrow = 2, \n                        byrow = TRUE)\n            A\n            ```\n            \n            ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n            \n            ```\n                 [,1] [,2]\n            [1,]    4    7\n            [2,]    2    6\n            ```\n            \n            \n            :::\n            \n            ```{.r .cell-code}\n            det(A)    # get the determinant of the matrix A     \n            ```\n            \n            ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n            \n            ```\n            [1] 10\n            ```\n            \n            \n            :::\n            \n            ```{.r .cell-code}\n            solve(A)  # get the inverse of the matrix A   \n            ```\n            \n            ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n            \n            ```\n                 [,1] [,2]\n            [1,]  0.6 -0.7\n            [2,] -0.2  0.4\n            ```\n            \n            \n            :::\n            \n            ```{.r .cell-code}\n            round(A %*% solve(A), 10)  # check if the product of A and its inverse is equal to the identity matrix \n            ```\n            \n            ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n            \n            ```\n                 [,1] [,2]\n            [1,]    1    0\n            [2,]    0    1\n            ```\n            \n            \n            :::\n            :::\n\n\n\n    -   The formulae for the `determinant` of matrices with dimensions greater than $2 \\times 2$ are complicated and are not covered here.\n\n    -   If a matrix has a `determinant` equal to zero, it is referred to as `singular` and is not invertible:\n\n        -   For example, $A = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 4 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{bmatrix} \\Rightarrow |A| = 2 \\times 2 - 4 \\times 1 = 4-4 = 0$, so matrix $A$ is `singular` and not invertible.\n\n        -   A singular matrix has linearly dependent rows or columns (i.e., one row or one column can be expressed as a linear combination of the others).\n\n        -   In the above example, the second row is linearly dependent on the first row (i.e., you can get the second row by multiplying the first row by $\\frac{1}{2}$). Similarly, the second column can be obtained by multiplying the first column by $2$.\n\n        -   A singular matrix suggests that solving a system of linear equations in the usual way is not possible.\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Rank of a matrix $(r)$\" style=\"color: #0466c8;\"}\n-   It is defined as the maximum number of linearly independent rows or columns.\n\n-   At most, the rank can be the number of rows ($m$) or the number of columns ($n$), so the maximum possible rank is limited by the smaller of the two dimensions $m$ and $n$.\n\n-   A matrix $A$ is said to have `full rank` if its rank is equal to the smaller of the number of rows or columns, i.e., $r = \\min(m, n)$.\n\n-   A matrix $A$ is `rank deficient` if $r \\lt \\min(m, n)$.\n\n-   If a square matrix with dimensions $n\\times  n$ is `rank deficient`, then it is `singular` and not invertible.\n\n-   Example:\n\n    -   $A = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ 2 & 4 & 6 \\\\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\n    -   Rows:\n\n        -   Row $2$ is linearly dependent on row $1$ (row $2 =$ $2\\ \\times$ row $1$).\n\n        -   Row $3$ is identical to row $1$, i.e, linearly dependent on it (row $3 =$ $1\\ \\times$ row $1$).\n\n        -   Therefore, there is only one independent row.\n\n    -   Columns:\n\n        -   Column $2$ is linearly dependent on column $1$ (column $2 =$ $2\\ \\times$ column $1$).\n\n        -   Column $3$ is linearly dependent on column \\$1\\$ (column $3 =$ $3\\ \\times$ colunm $1$).\n\n        -   Therefore, there is only one independent column.\n\n    -   Therefore, $r=1$\n\n    -   The rank of a matrix can be calculated in R as follows:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nA <- matrix(c(1, 2, 3,\n              2, 4, 6,\n              1, 2, 3), \n            nrow = 3, \n            byrow = TRUE)\n\n# get the rank of the matrix A through the QR decomposition method\nqr(A)$rank                   \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 1\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Confirm matrix A is singular by calculating its determinant\ndet(A)                       \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Get the inverse of the matrix A\nsolve(A) # The error confirms that the matrix A is not invertible\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n\n```\nError in solve.default(A): Lapack routine dgesv: system is exactly singular: U[2,2] = 0\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n### Orthogonal matrix\n\n-   A square matrix $A$ with dimensions $n\\times  n$ is referred to as `orthogonal`, if $AA^T = I_n$ or alternatively $A^T = A^{-1}$.\n\n### Sparse matrix\n\n-   It is a matrix in which most of the elements are zero (in contrast to a **dense matrix**, where most of the elements are non-zero).\n\n-   Example: $\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 5 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 3 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n    2 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\n-   Storing sparse matrices in the usual form would waste a lot of memory.

  $X = \\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\ y \\\\ z \\end{bmatrix}$, the matrix of variables (unknowns)\n\n    -   $B = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 3 \\end{bmatrix}$, the matrix of constants\n\n-   The unknowns can be calculated as $X = A^{-1}B$.\n\n-   The solution can be obtained in R as follows:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nA <- matrix(c(2, 3, 1, 4, 5, 2, 2, 10, 9), \n            nrow = 3, \n            byrow = TRUE)\n\nB <- matrix(c(1, 2, 3),\n            nrow = 3)\n\nX <- solve(A) %*% B\nX\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n      [,1]\n[1,] 0.375\n[2,] 0.000\n[3,] 0.250\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n-   So, $x = 0.375,\\ y = 0,\\ z = 0.25$ is the solution to this system of linear equations.\n\n-   This is the basis of calculating the least squares coefficients in multiple linear regression that will be covered under regression analysis.\n\n## Eigenvalues and eigenvectors\n\n-   For a `square matrix` $A$ with dimensions $n\\times  n$, a scalar (constant) $λ$ and a non-zero vector $v$ can be obtained satisfying the following equality $Av = \\lambda v$, where $\\lambda$ is known as the `eigenvalue` and $v$ is known as the `eigenvector`.\n\n-   This means that the transformation on the vector $v$ via the matrix $A$ is equivalent to transforming the vector $v$ via multiplying it by the scalar $λ$.\n\n-   This concept will be revisited while discussing principal component analysis (PCA) and factor analysis.\n\n-   Example:\n\n    -   $A = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 3 \\\\ 6 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\n    -   The `eigenvalues` and `eigenvectors` can be calculated in R using the function `eigen()`:\n\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    A <- matrix(c(2, 3, 6, 1), \n                nrow = 2, \n                byrow = TRUE)\n    \n    eig_A <- eigen(A)\n    eig_A\n    ```\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n    \n    ```\n    eigen() decomposition\n    $values\n    [1]  5.772002 -2.772002\n    \n    $vectors\n              [,1]       [,2]\n    [1,] 0.6224656 -0.5322295\n    [2,] 0.7826472  0.8466001\n    ```\n    \n    \n    :::\n    :::\n\n\n\n    -
