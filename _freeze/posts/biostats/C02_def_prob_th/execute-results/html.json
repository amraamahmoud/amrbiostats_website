When the number of trials increases and $n$ tends to infinity, the probability of getting a head will converge to $0.5$.\n\n        ::: {.callout-note style=\"color: #0466c8;\"}\n        -   A fair coin means that the probability of getting a head is equal to the probability of getting a tail $= 0.5$.\n        :::\n\n    [{{< iconify emojione-monotone:letter-c size=20px fill=blue >}}]{style=\"color: dodgerblue\"} **Classical approach**:\n\n    -   This is based on abstract reasoning and is used when all outcomes are **equally likely**.\n\n    -   If an experiment has mutually exclusive and equally likely $N$ outcomes or simple events, then the probability of an event $A$ is given by:\n\n    $$\n    \\text{Probability of}\\ A = \\frac{N(A)}{N(S)} =\\frac{\\text{Number of elements in}\\ A}{\\text{Total number elements in the sample space}}\n    $$\n\n    -   This approach is referred to as a priori concept of probability because it is based on theoretical reasoning and not on empirical data or experimentation (i.e., there is no need to conduct an experiment to determine the probability of an event).\n\n    -   For example, refer to [Example C.1.1](/posts/biostats/C01_intro_prob_th.qmd#tabset-C11) in the previous section about rolling a single die:\n\n        -   All the six numbers are equally likely to occur, and the probability of getting any number is $\\displaystyle \\frac{1}{6}$.\n\n        -   The probability of getting an even number is equal to the number of elements in the event $B = \\{2, 4, 6\\}$ divided by the total number of elements in the sample space $S = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$:\n\n        $$\n        \\text{Probability of}\\ B = \\frac{N(B)}{N(S)} = \\frac{3}{6} = 0.5\n        $$\n\n        -   The probability of getting a number divisible by $3$ is equal to the number of elements in the event $D = \\{3, 6\\}$ divided by the total number of elements in the sample space:\n\n        $$\n        \\text{Probability of}\\ D = \\frac{N(D)}{N(S)} = \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}\n        $$\n\n        -   The probability of $B \\cap D = \\{6\\}$ is equal to $\\displaystyle \\frac{1}{6}$.\n\n        -   As you notice, we do not need to roll the die to determine the probability of these events, rather we can determine them theoretically.\n\n## Formal definition and axioms of probability\n\n### Definition\n\n-   The probability is a set function $P$ that assigns a number to each event in the sample space.\n\n-   The probability of an event $A$ is denoted by $P(A)$.\n\n### Axioms\n\n-   Axioms refer to the basic or elementary rules of probability from which all other rules can be derived.\n\n    [{{< iconify bi:1-circle-fill size=20px fill=blue >}}]{style=\"color: dodgerblue\"} **Axiom 1**:\n\n    -   For an experiment with mutually exclusive outcomes, the probability of an event $A$ is a non-negative number (i.e., the probability is greater than or equal to $0$ and less than or equal to $1$):\n\n    $$\n    0 \\le P(A) \\le 1\n    $$\n\n    [{{< iconify bi:2-circle-fill size=20px fill=blue >}}]{style=\"color: dodgerblue\"} **Axiom 2**:\n\n    -   The sum of probabilities of all the mutually exclusive outcomes of an experiment is equal to $1$, i.e., the probability of the sample space $S$ is equal to $1$:\n\n    $$\n    P(A_1) + P(A_2) + P(A_3) + \\ldots + P(A_n) = P(S) = 1\n    $$\n\n    [{{< iconify bi:3-circle-fill size=20px fill=blue >}}]{style=\"color: dodgerblue\"} **Axiom 3**:\n\n    -   For any two mutually exclusive events $A_1$ and $A_2$, the probability of the union of these events is equal to the sum of the probabilities of the individual events:\n\n    $$\n    P(A_1 \\cup A_2) = P(A_1) + P(A_2) \n    $$\n\n    ::: {.callout-note style=\"color: #0466c8;\"}\n    -   When the events are not mutually exclusive (i.e., they can occur simultaneously), then the probability of their union will be $P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B)$, this is discussed in detail below.\n\n    -   The third axiom can be extended to more than two events: $P(A_1 \\cup A_2 \\cup A_3 \\cup \\ldots \\cup A_n) = P(A_1) + P(A_2) + P(A_3) + \\ldots + P(A_n)$\n    :::\n\n### Other probability rules\n\n[{{< iconify bi:1-circle-fill size=20px fill=blue >}}]{style=\"color: dodgerblue\"} $P(A) = 1 -
