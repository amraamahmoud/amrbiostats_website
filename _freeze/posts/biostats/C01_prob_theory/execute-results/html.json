  Let's assume that we are interested in answering the research question \"Are customers satisfied with the quality of a product?\":\n\n        -   We can select a random sample of customers and ask them about their satisfaction (satisfied or not satisfied).\n\n        -   The sample space: $S = \\{\\text{satisfied, not satisfied}\\}$\n\n-   Example 2:\n\n    -   Let's assume that we are interested in answering the research question \"How many days you go shopping per week?\":\n\n        -   We can select a random sample of people and ask them about the number of days they go shopping per week.\n\n        -   The sample space: $S = \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\}$\n\n-   The sample space can be finite, countably infinite, or infinite.\n\n    ::: {.callout-note style=\"color: #0466c8;\"}\n    \n    -   A countably infinite set contains infinite elements, however, its elements can be put in one-to-one correspondence with the set of natural numbers $\\mathbb{N}$ (positive integers: ${1, 2, 3, \\ldots}$)\n\n    -   This simply means the elements can be listed sequentially using the natural numbers without skipping any element.\n\n    -   For example the set of integers $\\mathbb{Z} = \\{\\ldots, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\}$ is a countably infinite set:\n\n        -   It has infinite elements, but we can list them sequentially using the natural numbers: $1 \\rightarrow 0, 2 \\rightarrow 1, 3 \\rightarrow -1, 4 \\rightarrow 2, 5 \\rightarrow -2, 6 \\rightarrow 3, \\ldots$.\n    :::\n\n### Event\n\n-   An event is a subset of the sample space $S$ and is denoted by uppercase letters $A, B, C, \\ldots$ (e.g., $A \\subseteq S$).\n\n-   $S$ is considered an event as it contains all the possible outcomes (because $S$ will always occur it is referred to as a **certain** or **sure** event).\n\n-   The empty or null set $\\emptyset = \\{\\}$ is also considered an event (this event will never occur and is referred to as an **impossible** event).\n\n-   The event that contains a single possible outcome of the random experiment is referred to as a **simple event** or an **elementary event**.  \n\n-   $A^c = A' = \\bar{A}$ is known as the **complement** of $A$ and contains the elements that are in $S$ but not in $A$.\n\n\n::: panel-tabset\n\n## Example C.1.1 {{< iconify ic:round-menu-book size=21px >}} \n\n::: {#tabset-C11}\nAssume a dice is rolled and we are interested in the number that appears on the top face:\n:::\n\n-   The sample space (sure event): $S = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$.\n    \n-   The event of getting a particular number (e.g., $3$) is an elementary event: $A = \\{3\\}$ ($A \\subset S$).\n\n-   The event of getting an even number: $B = \\{2, 4, 6\\}$ ($B \\subset S$).\n\n-   The event of getting an odd number: $C = \\{1, 3, 5\\}$ ($C \\subset S$).\n\n-   The event of getting a number divisible by $3$: $D = \\{3, 6\\}$ ($D \\subset S$).\n  \n-   The event of getting a negative number: $E = \\emptyset$ ($E \\subset S$), is an impossible event.\n\n:::\n\n### Some properties of sets and events\n\n-   $A \\cup B = A+B$ is known as the **union** of $A$ and $B$ and contains the elements that are in $A$ **or** $B$ **or** both (green-shaded).\n\n\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    library(venn)\n    \n    venn(2, zcolor = \"lightgreen\", opacity = 0.5)\n    ```\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output-display}\n    ![](C01_prob_theory_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n    :::\n    :::\n\n\n\n\n-   $A \\cap B = AB$ is known as the **intersection** of $A$ and $B$ and contains the elements that are in both $A$ **and** $B$ (blue-shaded).\n\n\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    library(venn)\n    venn(\"1-, 11, -1\", zcolor = \"white, dodgerblue, white\")\n    ```\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output-display}\n    ![](C01_prob_theory_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n    :::\n    :::\n\n\n\n\n-   If $A \\cap B = \\emptyset$, then $A$ and $B$ are said to be **mutually exclusive** or **disjoint** events.\n\n\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    ::: {.cell-output-display}\n    ![](C01_prob_theory_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n    :::\n    :::\n\n\n\n\n\n-   The events $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_n$ are mutually or pairwise disjoint, if $A_i \\cap A_j = \\emptyset$ for $i \\ne j = 1, 2, \\ldots, n$.\n\n-   If $A \\cap B \\cap C = \\emptyset$, and $A \\cup B \\cup C = S$, then $A, B, C$ are said to be mutually exclusive (i.e., no element belongs to more than one event) and exhaustive (the events together cover the entire sample space) events.\n\n\n-   $A'$ (complement of $A$) contains the elements that are in $S$ (green-shaded) but not in $A$ (blue-shaded).
