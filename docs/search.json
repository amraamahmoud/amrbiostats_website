    "text": "Quantitative variables have many unique values, which can lead to an extremely large number of categories.\nTherefore, these variables can be summarized by grouping the data into class intervals and counting the number of observations in each class interval.\nThe class intervals are selected to be contiguous, non-overlapping, and exhaustive in a way that each observation can be assigned to one and only one class interval.\nConstructing few class intervals may result in loss of information, while constructing too many class intervals may not satisfy the purpose of summarizing the data.\nA rule of thumb is to have between 5 and 15 class intervals.\nThere are different methods used as a guide to determine the number of class intervals, such as Sturges’ rule, square root method, Freedman-Diaconis’ rule, etc. For instance:\n\nSturges’ rule: \\(k = 1 + 3.322 \\log_{10}(n)\\), where \\(k\\) is the number of class intervals and \\(n\\) is the number of observations.\n\nExample: Consider the variable mpg (miles per gallon) in the mtcars dataset:\n\nFirst, let’s load the dataset and have a look at the variable:\n\n\nClick to show/hide code\n# load the mtcars dataset\ndata(mtcars)\n\n# display the values of the mpg variable\nmtcars$mpg\n\n\n [1] 21.0 21.0 22.8 21.4 18.7 18.1 14.3 24.4 22.8 19.2 17.8 16.4 17.3 15.2 10.4\n[16] 10.4 14.7 32.4 30.4 33.9 21.5 15.5 15.2 13.3 19.2 27.3 26.0 30.4 15.8 19.7\n[31] 15.0 21.4\n\n\nThe number of class intervals based on Sturges’ rule can be calculated by either of the following methods:\n\nStepwise calculationDirect calculation\n\n\n\n\nClick to show/hide code\n# determine the number of observations\nn &lt;- length(mtcars$mpg)\n\n# calculate the number of class intervals using Sturges' rule   \nk &lt;- 1 + 3.322 * log10(n)\npaste0('The number of class intervals = ', round(k))\n\n\n[1] \"The number of class intervals = 6\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to show/hide code\n# use nclass.Sturges() function \nk1  &lt;- nclass.Sturges(mtcars$mpg)\npaste0('The number of class intervals = ', round(k1))\n\n\n[1] \"The number of class intervals = 6\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe number of class intervals is 6 as suggested by Sturges’ rule.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nThese rules including Sturges’ rule are not strict but rather provide guidance to determine the number of class intervals.\nThe actual number of class intervals can vary based on the researcher’s judgment and the purpose of the analysis.\n\n\n\nThen, let’s calculate the range, which is the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the variable:\n\n\nClick to show/hide code\n# determine the minimum value of the mpg variable\nmin_mpg &lt;- min(mtcars$mpg)\n\n# determine the maximum value of the mpg variable\nmax_mpg &lt;- max(mtcars$mpg)\n\n# calculate the range of the mpg variable by subtracting the minimum from the maximum\nr &lt;- max_mpg - min_mpg\npaste0('Range = ', r)\n\n\n[1] \"Range = 23.5\"\n\n\nR has a built-in function range() that returns the maximum and minimum values directly:\n\n\nClick to show/hide code\nrange(mtcars$mpg)\n\n\n[1] 10.4 33.9\n\n\nThe width of each class interval is approximately equal to \\(\\displaystyle \\frac {\\text{Range}}{k} = \\frac{23.5}{6} = 3.9 \\approx 4\\).\nAs a rule of thumb, when appropriate, the width of the class interval is recommended to be of of 5 units, 10 units, or multiples of 10.\nThe first class interval should encompass the minimum (in this example \\(= 10.4\\)), while the last class interval should encompass the maximum (in this example \\(= 33.9\\)).\nA good starting point would be \\(10\\) and considering a width of \\(5\\) units, the boundaries of the class intervals would be \\(10, 15, 20, 25, 30, \\text {and}\\ 35\\).\nBecause each value should be assigned to one and only one class interval, the class intervals should be closed on one end and open on the other end, e.g., \\([10, 15], (15, 20], (20, 25], (25, 30], (30, 35]\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nThe square bracket [ ] denotes that the interval includes the corresponding lower or upper bound, while the parenthesis ( ) denotes that the interval excludes the corresponding lower or upper bound.\nFor instance, the second class interval \\((15, 20]\\) includes values greater than but not equal to \\(15\\) and less than or equal to \\(20\\) (i.e., \\(15 &lt; x \\leq 20\\)).\nThis type is called exclusive-inclusive (also known as half-open, half-closed) interval.\nThe first class interval should have a closed lower bound to include the minimum value, if coincidentally the minimum value is equal to the lower bound of the first class interval.\n\n\n\nThe class interval boundaries (i.e., breakpoints) can also be determined directly using the pretty() function in R:\n\n\nClick to show/hide code\nbp &lt;- pretty(mtcars$mpg)\npaste0(\n   'The class interval breakpoints = ', \n   paste(bp, collapse = \", \")\n)\n\n\n[1] \"The class interval breakpoints = 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35\"\n\n\nWe can use R to create a frequency distribution table for the mpg variable as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to show/hide code\nlibrary(DT)\n\n# create a vector to assign each value to a class interval\nmpg_class &lt;-\n  cut(\n    mtcars$mpg,\n    breaks = seq(10, 35, by = 5),\n    include.lowest = TRUE,\n    right = TRUE\n  )\n\n# include.lowest = TRUE ensures that the minimum value is included in the first class interval or the maximum value is included in the last class interval if right argument is set to FALSE.\n\n# right = TRUE ensures that the intervals are left-open and right-closed.\n\n# create a frequency distribution table for the mpg variable\nfreq_tbl_1 &lt;- table(mpg_class)\n\n# create a data frame from the frequency table\nfreq_tbl_df_1 &lt;- data.frame(freq_tbl_1)\n\n# convert the mpg_class column to character\nfreq_tbl_df_1$mpg_class &lt;- as.character(freq_tbl_df_1$mpg_class)\n\n# add a row for the

  list(\n        className = \"dt-center\",\n        targets = \"_all\"\n      )\n    )\n  ),\n  rownames = FALSE\n)\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Frequency distribution of the mpg variable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelative frequency of a class interval:\n\nIt is the proportion of observations that fall within that class interval relative to the total number of observations.\nIt is simply calculated by dividing the frequency of that class interval by the total number of observations.\n\nCumulative frequency:\n\nAs the name implies, it is the frequency of values falling within two or more class intervals.\nAt each class interval, we calculate the sum of the frequency of that class interval and all previous class intervals.\n\nCumulative relative frequency:\n\nIt is calculated by dividing the cumulative frequency by the total number of observations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nThe relative frequency, cumulative frequency, and cumulative relative frequency are calculated for categorical variables in the same way as for numerical variables.\n\n\n\n\nThe relative frequency, cumulative frequency, and cumulative relative frequency of the mpg variable can be calculated as follows:\n\nThe relative frequencies:\n\n\nClick to show/hide code\n# calculate the relative frequency\nrel_freq_1 &lt;-

Table 2:\n\nThe relative frequency of the class interval \\((20, 25] = \\displaystyle \\frac{8}{32} = 0.25\\).\nThe cumulative frequency at the class interval \\((20, 25] = 6 + 12 + 8 = 26\\), which represents the number of observations that fall within the wider class interval \\([10, 25]\\) that incorporates the class intervals \\([10, 15]\\), \\((15, 20]\\), and \\((20, 25]\\).\nThe cumulative relative frequency at the class interval \\((20, 25] = \\displaystyle \\frac{6}{32} + \\frac{12}{32} + \\frac{8}{32} = \\frac{26}{32} = 0.8125\\).\nNotice:\n\nThe relative frequencies should sum up to 1.\nThe cumulative relative frequency at the last class interval should be 1.\n\n\nThe above frequency distribution table can constructed directly using freq() function from the summarytools package as follows:\n\n\nClick to show/hide code\nlibrary(summarytools)\nlibrary(DT)\n\ndatatable(\n  freq(\n    cut(\n      mtcars$mpg, \n      breaks = pretty(mtcars$mpg), \n      include.lowest = T, \n      right = T\n    )\n  ),   \n  options = list(\n    dom = \"t\",\n    columnDefs = list(\n      list(\n        className = \"dt-center\", \n        targets = \"_all\"\n      )\n    )\n )\n   )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is a graphical way to display the distribution of quantitative variables.\nIt can be used when the number of observations is not too large.\nIt is similar to the histogram (will be discussed shortly) but retains the original data values.\nThe stem-and-leaf plot is constructed by dividing each observation into two parts, the stem and the leaf separated by a vertical line \\((|)\\).\nStem:\n\nThe stem is the leftmost digit(s) of the observation.\nForm a column to the left of the vertical line arranged in ascending order from top to bottom.\n\nLeaf:\n\nThe leaf is the rightmost digit(s) of the observation.\nThey are ordered and placed to the right of the vertical line with the corresponding stem.\n\nEven though R has a bulit in function to create stem-and-leaf plots, the stem.leaf() function from the aplpack package provides more informative output and is more flexible with regard to customization:\n\n\nClick to show/hide code\nlibrary(aplpack)\n\nstem.leaf(\nmtcars$mpg,\nstyle = \"bare\", \nm = 2  # number of parts (rows) to which the stem is divided\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above output can be interpreted as follows:\n\nThis header indicates that stem should be interpreted as tens (or hundreds, etc), whereas leaf should be interpreted as ones not as tenth decimal place (i.e., interpret \\(1\\ |\\ 2\\) as \\(12\\) not \\(1.2\\)). This can be controlled using the argument unit, which accepts numbers as power of 10 (e.g., 2, 1, 0.1, 0.01, etc).\nThis shows that the leaf unit is 1 (i.e., the leaf represents the ones place).\nThis shows the ntotal number of observations.\nThis column shows the stem values (i.e., the tens place); Each stem is separated into two parts (rows), the first contains leaves from 0 to 4, and the second contains leaves from 5 to 9.\nThis shows the leaves (i.e., the ones place) corresponding to the stem values.\nThis column is referred to as the depths, which shows the accumulated frequencies from the top and bottom of the plot until reaching the row that contains the middle value (i.e., the median). So, the last \\((5^{\\text{th}})\\) row has depth of \\(4\\) because there are \\(4\\) observations (leaves) with stem value \\(3\\). The second row from the bottom \\((4^{\\text{th}})\\) has a depth of \\(6\\) because there are \\(4\\) leaves in the \\(5^{\\text{th}}\\) row and \\(2\\) leaves in the \\(4^{\\text{th}}\\) row.\nThis shows the row containing the middle value (i.e., the median). The frequency of leaves in this row is placed in parentheses to indicate that the median is in this row. For example, the median of the mpg variable is \\(19.2\\), which is in the \\(2^{\\text{nd}}\\) row that contains \\(13\\) leaves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nIn the above example, the decimals have been omitted from the leaves because the unit argument is set to 1 (i.e., the leaves represent the ones place).\nSometimes, a plus \\((+)\\) is added at the end of one or more rows to indicate that the leaves exceed the row capacity, and thus, the leaves are not shown in the plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is used to graphically represent the distribution of values of quantitative variables, particularly when there are a large number of observations.\nIt can be used to get insights about the underlying shape of the distribution that generated the data based on the sample.\nThe class intervals are represented on the horizontal axis, whereas the vertical axis represents the frequency of the values or the relative frequency density scale.\nEach class interval on the horizontal axis has a rectangular vertical bar.\nIf the vertical axis scale is the frequency, the height \\((h_i)\\) of the bar corresponds to the frequency \\((n_i)\\) of that class interval (i.e., \\(h_i = n_i\\)).\nIf the vertical axis scale is the density, the height of the bar corresponds to relative frequency \\(\\left ( f_i = \\displaystyle \\frac{n_i}{\\sum n_i} \\right)\\) of that class interval divided by the width \\((d_i)\\) of the class interval (i.e., \\(h_i = \\displaystyle \\frac{f_i}{d_i}\\)):\n\nTherefore, the area of each bar \\(= \\text {height} \\times \\text {width} = \\displaystyle \\frac{f_i}{\\cancel{d_i}} \\times \\cancel{d}_i = f_i\\) (i.e., the relative frequency).\nIn this context, the bars can have different widths because the area of each bar is proportional to the relative frequency (however, usually the bars have equal width).\n\nThe bars are contiguous, non-overlapping, and possess no gaps.\nThe histogram of the mpg variable can be created as follows:\n\nBase RUsing ggplot2\n\n\n\n\nClick to show/hide code\n# adjust the plot layout to display two plots side by side\npar(mfrow=c(1,2))\n\n# create a histogram based on frequency\nhist(\n  x = mtcars$mpg,\n  main = \"Histogram based \\n on frequency\",   #

    "text": "Quantitative variables have many unique values, which can lead to an extremely large number of categories.\nTherefore, these variables can be summarized by grouping the data into class intervals and counting the number of observations in each class interval.\nThe class intervals are selected to be contiguous, non-overlapping, and exhaustive in a way that each observation can be assigned to one and only one class interval.\nConstructing few class intervals may result in loss of information, while constructing too many class intervals may not satisfy the purpose of summarizing the data.\nA rule of thumb is to have between 5 and 15 class intervals.\nThere are different methods used as a guide to determine the number of class intervals, such as Sturges’ rule, square root method, Freedman-Diaconis’ rule, etc. For instance:\n\nSturges’ rule: \\(k = 1 + 3.322 \\log_{10}(n)\\), where \\(k\\) is the number of class intervals and \\(n\\) is the number of observations.\n\nExample: Consider the variable mpg (miles per gallon) in the mtcars dataset:\n\nFirst, let’s load the dataset and have a look at the variable:\n\n\nClick to show/hide code\n# load the

suggested by Sturges’ rule.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nThese rules including Sturges’ rule are not strict but rather provide guidance to determine the number of class intervals.\nThe actual number of class intervals can vary based on the researcher’s judgment and the purpose of the analysis.\n\n\n\nThen, let’s calculate the range, which is the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the variable:\n\n\nClick to show/hide code\n# determine the minimum value of the mpg variable\nmin_mpg &lt;- min(mtcars$mpg)\n\n# determine the maximum value of the mpg variable\nmax_mpg &lt;-

built-in function range() that returns the maximum and minimum values directly:\n\n\nClick to show/hide code\nrange(mtcars$mpg)\n\n\n[1] 10.4 33.9\n\n\nThe width of each class interval is approximately equal to \\(\\displaystyle \\frac {\\text{Range}}{k} = \\frac{23.5}{6} = 3.9 \\approx 4\\).\nAs a rule of thumb, when appropriate, the width of the class interval is recommended to be of of 5 units, 10 units, or multiples of 10.\nThe first class interval should encompass the minimum (in this example \\(= 10.4\\)), while the last class interval should encompass the maximum (in this example \\(= 33.9\\)).\nA good starting point would be \\(10\\) and considering a width of \\(5\\) units, the boundaries of the class intervals would be \\(10, 15, 20, 25, 30, \\text {and}\\ 35\\).\nBecause each value should be assigned to one and only one class interval, the class intervals should be closed on one end and open on the other end, e.g., \\([10, 15], (15, 20], (20, 25], (25, 30], (30, 35]\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nThe square bracket [ ] denotes that the interval includes the corresponding lower or upper bound, while the parenthesis ( ) denotes that the interval excludes the corresponding lower or upper bound.\nFor instance, the second class interval \\((15, 20]\\) includes values greater than but not equal to \\(15\\) and less than or equal to \\(20\\) (i.e., \\(15 &lt; x \\leq 20\\)).\nThis type is called exclusive-inclusive (also known as half-open, half-closed) interval.\nThe first class interval should have a closed lower bound to include the minimum value, if coincidentally the minimum value is equal to the lower bound of the first class interval.\n\n\n\nThe class interval boundaries (i.e., breakpoints) can also be determined directly

Table 2:\n\nThe relative frequency of the class interval \\((20, 25] = \\displaystyle \\frac{8}{32} = 0.25\\).\nThe cumulative frequency at the class interval \\((20, 25] = 6 + 12 + 8 = 26\\), which represents the number of observations that fall within the wider class interval \\([10, 25]\\) that incorporates the class intervals \\([10, 15]\\), \\((15, 20]\\), and \\((20, 25]\\).\nThe cumulative relative frequency at the class interval \\((20, 25] = \\displaystyle \\frac{6}{32} + \\frac{12}{32} + \\frac{8}{32} = \\frac{26}{32} = 0.8125\\).\nNotice:\n\nThe relative frequencies should sum up to 1.\nThe cumulative relative frequency at the last class interval should be 1.\n\n\nThe above frequency distribution table can constructed directly using freq() function from the summarytools package as follows:\n\n\nClick to show/hide code\nlibrary(summarytools)\nlibrary(DT)\n\ndatatable(\n  freq(\n    cut(\n      mtcars$mpg, \n      breaks = pretty(mtcars$mpg), \n      include.lowest = T, \n      right = T\n    )\n  ),   \n  options = list(\n    dom = \"t\",\n    columnDefs = list(\n      list(\n        className = \"dt-center\", \n        targets = \"_all\"\n      )\n    )\n )\n   )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is a graphical way to display the distribution of quantitative variables.\nIt can be used when the number of observations is not too large.\nIt is similar to the histogram (will be discussed shortly) but retains the original data values.\nThe stem-and-leaf plot is constructed by dividing each observation into two parts, the stem and the leaf separated by a vertical line \\((|)\\).\nStem:\n\nThe stem is the leftmost digit(s) of the observation.\nForm a column to the left of the vertical line arranged in ascending order from top to bottom.\n\nLeaf:\n\nThe leaf is the rightmost digit(s) of the observation.\nThey are ordered and placed to the right of the vertical line with the corresponding stem.\n\nEven though R has a bulit in function to create stem-and-leaf plots, the stem.leaf() function from the aplpack package provides more informative output and is more flexible with regard to customization:\n\n\nClick to show/hide code\nlibrary(aplpack)\n\nstem.leaf(\nmtcars$mpg,\nstyle = \"bare\", \nm = 2  # number of parts (rows) to which the stem is divided\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above output can be interpreted as follows:\n\nThis header indicates that stem should be interpreted as tens (or hundreds, etc), whereas leaf should be interpreted as ones not as tenth decimal place (i.e., interpret \\(1\\ |\\ 2\\) as \\(12\\) not \\(1.2\\)). This can be controlled using the argument unit, which accepts numbers as power of 10 (e.g., 2, 1, 0.1, 0.01, etc).\nThis shows that the leaf unit is 1 (i.e., the leaf represents the ones place).\nThis shows the ntotal number of observations.\nThis column shows the stem values (i.e., the tens place); Each stem is separated into two parts (rows), the first contains leaves from 0 to 4, and the second contains leaves from 5 to 9.\nThis shows the leaves (i.e., the ones place) corresponding to the stem values.\nThis column is referred to as the depths, which shows the accumulated frequencies from the top and bottom of the plot until reaching the row that contains the middle value (i.e., the median). So, the last \\((5^{\\text{th}})\\) row has depth of \\(4\\) because there are \\(4\\) observations (leaves) with stem value \\(3\\). The second row from the bottom \\((4^{\\text{th}})\\) has a depth of \\(6\\) because there are \\(4\\) leaves in the \\(5^{\\text{th}}\\) row and \\(2\\) leaves in the \\(4^{\\text{th}}\\) row.\nThis shows the row containing the middle value (i.e., the median). The frequency of leaves in this row is placed in parentheses to indicate that the median is in this row. For example, the median of the mpg variable is \\(19.2\\), which is in the \\(2^{\\text{nd}}\\) row that contains \\(13\\) leaves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nIn the above example, the decimals have been omitted from the leaves because the unit argument is set to 1 (i.e., the leaves represent the ones place).\nSometimes, a plus \\((+)\\) is added at the end of one or more rows to indicate that the leaves exceed the row capacity, and thus, the leaves are not shown in the plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is used to graphically represent the distribution of values of quantitative variables, particularly when there are a large number of observations.\nIt can be used to get insights about the underlying shape of the distribution that generated the data based on the sample.\nThe class intervals are represented on the horizontal axis, whereas the vertical axis represents the frequency of the values or the relative frequency density scale.\nEach class interval on the horizontal axis has a rectangular vertical bar.\nIf the vertical axis scale is the frequency, the height \\((h_i)\\) of the bar corresponds to the frequency \\((n_i)\\) of that class interval (i.e., \\(h_i = n_i\\)).\nIf the vertical axis scale is the density, the height of the bar corresponds to relative frequency \\(\\left ( f_i = \\displaystyle \\frac{n_i}{\\sum n_i} \\right)\\) of that class interval divided by the width \\((d_i)\\) of the class interval (i.e., \\(h_i = \\displaystyle \\frac{f_i}{d_i}\\)):\n\nTherefore, the area of each bar \\(= \\text {height} \\times \\text {width} = \\displaystyle \\frac{f_i}{\\cancel{d_i}} \\times \\cancel{d}_i = f_i\\) (i.e., the relative frequency).\nIn this context, the bars can have different widths because the area of each bar is proportional to the relative frequency (however, usually the bars have equal width).\n\nThe bars are contiguous, non-overlapping, and possess no gaps.\nThe histogram of the mpg variable can be created as follows:\n\nBase RUsing ggplot2\n\n\n\n\nClick to show/hide code\n# adjust the plot layout to display two plots side by side\npar(mfrow=c(1,2))\n\n# create a histogram based on frequency\nhist(\n  x = mtcars$mpg,\n  main = \"Histogram based \\n on frequency\",   #

Different bin sizes can give a different impression of the underlying distribution.\nThis problem can be addressed by using the kernel density plot, which is a smoothed version of the histogram and less sensitive to the choice of the number of bins:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the kernel density plot, the shape of the distribution is represented by a continuous function (i.e., curve) estimated from the sample data.\nLike histograms, the density plots give insights about the underlying shape of the distribution that generated the data based on the sample.\nIn simple words, the kernel density estimation (KDE) is based on the idea that the more data points are clustered together, the higher is the probability density in that region (i.e., the higher is the probability of an observation falling in that region):\n\nKDE places a small kernel (bump) centered at each data point.\nThe density of the bump is highest at the data points and decreases by moving away from the data points.\nThe small kernels (bumps) are summed to estimate the overall density at each point.\n\nAssume the following set of data: \\(5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12\\):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the above density plot:\n\nThe dashed blue lines represent the small bumps (kernel functions) centered at each data point.\nThe solid red line represents the overall kernel density estimate.\nThe green tickmarks at the bottom of the plot represent the data points.\n\nThe small bumps are summed to estimate the overall density.\nThe overall desnsity is highest between 5 and 8 because more data points are clustered in that region.\n\nThe kernel function used for the estimation is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\displaystyle \\hat f_n(x) = \\frac{1}{nh} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} K \\left( \\frac{x - x_i}{h} \\right)\n\\]\n\n\n\\(\\hat f_n(x)\\) is the kernel density estimate at \\(x\\)\n\\(n\\) is the number of observations\n\\(h\\) is the bandwidth, \\(h &gt; 0\\)\n\\(\\displaystyle K \\left( \\frac{x - x_i}{h} \\right)\\) is the kernel function (mentioned below as \\(K(u)\\), where \\(u = \\displaystyle \\frac{x - x_i}{h}\\))\n\\(x_i\\) is the \\(i^{\\text{th}}\\) observation of the data\n\n\n\nThere are different kernel functions, such as the Gaussian kernel, Epanechnikov kernel, rectangular kernel, etc:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKernel Function\nFormula\n\n\n\n\nGaussian (default in R)\n\\[\nK(u) = \\displaystyle \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-\\large \\frac{u^2}{2}}\n\\]\n\n\nEpanechnikov\n\\[\n    K(u) =\n    \\begin{cases}\n    \\displaystyle \\frac{3}{4}(1 - u^2) &  \\quad \\text{if}\\ |u| \\lt 1 \\\\ \\\\\n    0 & \\quad \\text{otherwise}\n    \\end{cases}\n\\]\n\n\nRectangular\n\\[\n    K(u) =\n    \\begin{cases}\n    \\displaystyle \\frac{1}{2} &  \\quad \\text{if}\\ -1 \\le u \\le 1 \\\\ \\\\\n    0 & \\quad \\text{otherwise}\n    \\end{cases}\n\\]\n\n\n\nCharacteristics of the kernel function:\n\nThe kernel function is symmetric around zero.\nThe kernel function integrates to one (this makes the kernel density estimator a probability density function, a concept tha will be discussed in upcoming tutorials).\n\nThe kernel density plot for the mpg variable can be created in R as follows :\n\nBase RUsing ggplot2\n\n\n\n\nClick to show/hide code\n# create a kernel density plot using the default Gaussian kernel\nplot(\n  density(\n    mtcars$mpg\n  ),\n  main = \"Kernel density plot\",\n  xlab = \"Miles per Gallon (MPG)\",\n  ylab = \"Density\",\n  col = \"#0466c8\",\n  lwd = 2, \n  ylim = c(0, 0.08)\n)\n\n# add a kernel density plot using the Epanechnikov kernel \nlines(\n  density(\n    mtcars$mpg,\n    kernel = \"epanechnikov\",\n  ),\n  col = \"#e63946\",\n  lty = \"dashed\", \n  lwd = 1.5\n)\n\n# add a legend\nlegend(\n  \"topleft\",\n  legend = c(\"Gaussian\", \"Epanechnikov\"),\n  col = c(\"#0466c8\", \"#e63946\"),\n  lty = c(\"solid\", \"dashed\"),\n  lwd = c(2, 1.5)\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to show/hide code\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n# create a kernel density plot using the default Gaussian kernel\nggplot(\n  data = mtcars, \n  aes(x = mpg)\n) +  #

    "text": "1 The idea of integration\n\nIntegration is considered the reverse process of differentiation.\nSo, it is used to find the original function \\(f(x)\\) from its derivative \\(f'(x)\\).\nLet \\(\\displaystyle y = x^3+ 2x\\), the first derivative is \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{dy}{dx} = 3x^2 + 2\\). Inversely, we say that the integral of \\(\\displaystyle 3x^2 + 2\\) with respect to \\(x\\) is \\(\\displaystyle x^3 + 2x + c\\), where \\(c\\) is the constant of integration.\nAdding this constant is important because the derivative \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{dy}{dx} = 3x^2 + 2\\) could have been obtained from different functions, e.g., \\(\\displaystyle x^3 + 2x + 1\\) or \\(\\displaystyle x^3 + 2x - 25\\), etc.\nDuring the integration process, the constant term in the original function is unknown, therefore, the constant of integration \\(c\\) is added to account for this unknown term.\nThe integration of the above function is denoted by \\(\\displaystyle \\int (3x^2 + 2)dx = x^3 + 2x + c\\):\n\nThe symbol \\(\\displaystyle \\int\\) is the integral sign.\nThe function to be integrated is known as the integrand.\nThe term \\(dx\\) indicates the variable with respect to which the integration is carried out.\n\\(c\\) is the constant of integration.\n\nTypes of integrals:\n\nIndefinite integral:\n\nThe integral of a function without limits, e.g., \\(\\displaystyle \\int f(x)dx\\).\nThe result is a function with an unknown constant of integration.\n\nDefinite integral:\n\nThe integral of a function over a specific interval, e.g., \\(\\displaystyle \\int_{a}^{b} f(x)dx\\).\nThe result is a number.\n\\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are numbers known as the lower and upper limits of the integral, respectively.",

    "text": "4 Limits at infinity\n\nThe limit of a function as \\(x\\) approaches infinity or negative infinity is referred to as the limit at infinity and is denoted by \\(\\displaystyle \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x)\\) or \\(\\displaystyle \\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x)\\).\nThese limits describe how the function behaves as \\(x\\) becomes very large or very small (i.e., \\(x\\) increases or decreases without bound), respectively.\nThe limit at infinity can be calculated by plugging in very large or very small values of \\(x\\) into the function.\nExample:\n\nLet \\(\\displaystyle f(x) = \\frac{1}{x}\\).\n\\(\\displaystyle \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{x} = 0\\):\n\nAs the value of \\(x\\) becomes very large, the value of the function becomes very small.\nAs the value of \\(x\\) approaches infinity, the value of the function approaches zero.\n\n\\(\\displaystyle \\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} \\frac{1}{x} = 0\\).\n\nAs the value of \\(x\\) becomes very small (\\(x\\) ignoring the negative sign becomes very large), the value of the function becomes very small.\nAs the value of \\(x\\) approaches negative infinity, the value of the function approaches zero.\n\n\nExample:\n\nLet \\(f(x) =x^2 -3x\\).\nTo evaluate \\(\\displaystyle \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} (x^2 -3x)\\), we cannot simply substitute \\(x = \\infty\\) into the function because the result will be \\(\\infty - \\infty\\), which is undefined.\nA workaround is to factor out the largest power of \\(x\\) in the function as follows:\n\n\\(\\displaystyle \\lim_{x \\to \\infty}  (x^2 -3x) = \\displaystyle \\lim_{x \\to \\infty}  x^2(1 - \\frac{3}{x}) = \\displaystyle \\lim_{x \\to \\infty}x^2 \\times \\displaystyle \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} (1 - \\frac{3}{x})\\).\nThe first term, \\(\\displaystyle \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} x^2 = \\infty\\) (as \\(x\\) approaches infinity, the value of \\(x^2\\) also approaches infinity).\nThe second term, \\(\\displaystyle \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} (1 - \\frac{3}{x}) = 1 - \\displaystyle \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{3}{x} = 1 - 0 = 1\\).\nTherefore, \\(\\displaystyle \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} (x^2 -3x) = \\infty \\times 1 = \\infty\\).\nThe above example could have been solved more simply by considering the term with the highest power of \\(x\\) in the function (i.e., \\(x^2\\)), which is the dominant term as \\(x\\) approaches infinity or negative infinity. The other terms are relatively insignificant.\nTherefore, to evaluate \\(\\displaystyle \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} (x^2 -3x)\\), ignore the term \\(-3x\\) and consider only the term \\(x^2\\) \\(\\Rightarrow \\displaystyle \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} (x^2 -3x) = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} x^2 = \\infty\\).\n\n\n\n\n4.1 Facts about limits at infinity\n\n\\(\\displaystyle \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{c}{x^r} = 0\\), where \\(c\\) is any real number and \\(r\\) is a positive rational number.\n\\(\\displaystyle \\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} \\frac{c}{x^r} = 0\\), where \\(c\\) is any real number, \\(r\\) is a positive rational number, and \\(x^r\\) is defined for \\(x \\lt 0\\).\n\\(\\displaystyle \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} x^r = \\infty\\), where \\(r\\) is a positive rational number.\n\\(\\displaystyle \\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} x^r = \\infty\\), where \\(r\\) is a positive even integer.\n\\(\\displaystyle \\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} x^r = -\\infty\\), where \\(r\\) is a positive odd integer.\n\\(\\displaystyle \\lim_{x \\to \\pm \\infty} {a_n}{x^n} + {a_{n - 1}}{x^{n - 1}} +  \\cdots  + {a_1}x + {a_0} = \\displaystyle \\lim_{x \\to \\pm \\infty} {a_n}{x^n}\\), where \\(a_n \\ne 0\\).\n\n\nExample M.9.3 \n\n\nEvaluate the limit \\(\\displaystyle \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\sqrt{2x^2+3}}{1-x}\\)\n\\[\n\\displaystyle \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\sqrt{2x^2+3}}{1-x} =\n\\]\n\\[\n\\displaystyle \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\sqrt{x^2(2+\\large \\frac{3}{x^2})}}{x(\\large \\frac{1}{x}-1)} =\n\\]\n\\[\n\\displaystyle \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\sqrt{x^2} \\cdot \\sqrt{(2+\\large \\frac{3}{x^2})}}{x(\\large \\frac{1}{x}-1)} =\n\\]\n\\[\n\\displaystyle \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\cancel{x} \\cdot \\sqrt{(2+\\large \\frac{3}{x^2})}}{\\cancel{x}(\\large \\frac{1}{x}-1)} =\n\\]\n\\[\n\\displaystyle \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\sqrt{(2+\\large \\frac{3}{x^2})}}{(\\large \\frac{1}{x}-1)} = \\frac{\\sqrt{(2+0)}}{(0-1)} = -\\sqrt{2}\n\\]",

Similarly, the second column can be obtained by multiplying the first column by \\(2\\).\nA singular matrix suggests that solving a system of linear equations in the usual way is not possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRank of a matrix \\((r)\\)\n\n\n\n\nIt is defined as the maximum number of linearly independent rows or columns.\nAt most, the rank can be the number of rows (\\(m\\)) or the number of columns (\\(n\\)), so the maximum possible rank is limited by the smaller of the two dimensions \\(m\\) and \\(n\\).\nA matrix \\(A\\) is said to have full rank if its rank is equal to the smaller of the number of rows or columns, i.e., \\(r = \\min(m, n)\\).\nA matrix \\(A\\) is rank deficient if \\(r \\lt \\min(m, n)\\).\nIf a square matrix with dimensions \\(n\\times  n\\) is rank deficient, then it is singular and not invertible.\nExample:\n\n\\(A = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ 2 & 4 & 6 \\\\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\end{bmatrix}\\)\nRows:\n\nRow \\(2\\) is linearly dependent on row \\(1\\) (row \\(2 =\\) \\(2\\ \\times\\) row \\(1\\)).\nRow \\(3\\) is identical to row \\(1\\), i.e, linearly dependent on it (row \\(3 =\\) \\(1\\ \\times\\) row \\(1\\)).\nTherefore, there is only one independent row.\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn \\(2\\) is linearly dependent on column \\(1\\) (column \\(2 =\\) \\(2\\ \\times\\) column \\(1\\)).\nColumn \\(3\\) is linearly dependent on column $1$ (column \\(3 =\\) \\(3\\ \\times\\) colunm \\(1\\)).\nTherefore, there is only one independent column.\n\nTherefore, \\(r=1\\)\nThe rank of a matrix can be calculated in R as follows:\n\n\n\n\nClick to show/hide code\nA &lt;- matrix(c(1, 2, 3,\n              2, 4, 6,\n              1, 2, 3), \n            nrow = 3, \n            byrow = TRUE)\n\n# get the rank of the matrix A through the QR decomposition method\nqr(A)$rank                   \n\n\n[1] 1\n\n\nClick to show/hide code\n# Confirm matrix A is singular by calculating its determinant\ndet(A)                       \n\n\n[1] 0\n\n\nClick to show/hide code\n# Get the inverse of the matrix A\nsolve(A) # The error confirms that the matrix A is not invertible\n\n\nError in solve.default(A): Lapack routine dgesv: system is exactly singular: U[2,2] = 0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.6 Orthogonal matrix\n\nA square matrix \\(A\\) with dimensions \\(n\\times  n\\) is referred to as orthogonal, if \\(AA^T = I_n\\) or alternatively \\(A^T = A^{-1}\\).\n\n\n\n2.7 Sparse matrix\n\nIt is a matrix in which most of the elements are zero (in contrast to a dense matrix, where most of the elements are non-zero).\nExample: \\(\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 5 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 3 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n2 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\\)\nStoring sparse matrices in the usual form would waste a lot of memory. Therefore, special methods are used to store only the non-zero elements and their locations.",

    "text": "2 Random variables\n\nWhen the values of the variable are the result of chance factors (i.e., the values are subject to randomness or uncertainty), the variable is refered to as a random variable.\nFor example, when a coin is flipped, the outcome (head or tail) is random and can not be predicted with certainty until experiment is performed (i.e., the coin is flipped).\n\n\n2.1 Types of variables\n\n2.1.1 Independent and Dependent variables\n\nIndependent variable:\n\nIt is a variable that is manipulated or controlled by the researcher during an experiment.\nIt has other names such as predictor, explanatory, or treatment variable.\nIt may have different levels or categories.\n\nDependent variable:\n\nIt is a variable that is measured or observed during an experiment in response to changes in the independent variable(s).\nIt has other names such as outcome or response variable.\n\nExample:\n\nIn a study evaluating the effect of three medications on lowering blood pressure in hypertensive patients:\n\nThe medication type is the independent variable that has three levels (medication A, medication B, and medication C).\nThe blood pressure is the dependent variable.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Qualitative and Quantitative variables\n\nQualitative (categorical) variables:\n\nThey can not be measured in the usual sense but can be only classified into categories (i.e., they express a quality or attribute).\nExamples: hair color, socioeconomic status, etc.\n\nQuantitative (numerical) variables:\n\nThey represent measurable quantities that can be expressed in terms of numbers.\nExamples: age, weight, blood pressure, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nQualitative variables can be assigned numbers for coding purposes, however, these numbers do not have any numerical significance.\nFor example:\n\nThe categories of the variable gender {“male” and “female”} can be coded as {0 and 1}, {1 and 2}, or {2 and 1}, etc.\nThe selection of codes is arbitrary and does not imply any numerical order.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.3 Discrete and Continuous variables\n\nDiscrete variables:\n\nThey can take only whole numbers (i.e., integers).\nThey can be described as having no intermediate values between two adjacent values (i.e., they have gaps or interruptions in the values that they can assume).\nDiscrete variables can be either qualitative or quantitative (all qualitative variables are discrete by definition).\nExamples:\n\nNumber of migraine attacks, number of children in a family, number of hospital admissions , etc.\nThe above variables can take whole numbers such as 0, 1, 2, 3, …., but they can not be fractional numbers such as 1.34, 2.76, etc.\n\n\nContinuous variables:\n\nUnlike discrete variables, continuous variables can take any value within a given range.\nThey do not have gaps or interruptions in the values that they can assume (i.e., between any two values, there are an infinite number of other values).\nExamples:\n\nAge, weight, height, blood pressure, etc.\nThe above variables can take any value within a given range (e.g., weight can be 25.3, 30.6, 45.8 kg, etc.).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nContinuous variables are often recorded rounded to a certain number of decimal places as if they were discrete variables.\nThe cause of this is the limitations of the measuring instruments used to collect the data (the scale in the case of weight, the thermometer in the case of temperature, etc.).\nTherefore, the weight of an individual can take infinite values between say 70 and 71 kg, but in practice it is recorded rounded to the nearest decimal place (e.g., 70.3, 70.6, 70.8 kg, etc.) because of the lack of precise measurement.",

    "section": "3 Scales of measurement",
    "text": "3 Scales of measurement\n\nMeasurement can be defined as the assignment of numbers to objects or events according to certain rules.\nDifferent scales of measurement arise from the fact that numbers can be assigned to objects or events under different sets of rules.\nEach scale of measurement has its own properties that affect the type of statistical analysis that can be performed on the data.\nThese properties include the order of the categories, the distance between the categories, and the presence of a true zero point.\nAccording to Stevens (1946), there are four scales of measurement:\n\nNominal scale:\n\nIt involves naming or classifying observations into categories that are mutually exclusive (i.e., categories that do not overlap) and collectively exhaustive (i.e., every observation must fall into one of the categories).\nThe categories have no inherent order or ranking.\nExamples of nominal scale variables:\n\nBlood type (A, B, AB, and O).\nHair color (black, brown, blonde, and red).\nGender (male and female).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nA nominal variable that possesses only two categories is referred to as a dichotomous or binary variable (e.g., gender, yes/no response).\n\n\n\n\nOrdinal scale:\n\nLike the nominal scale, the ordinal scale involves naming or classifying observations into categories that are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive.\nHowever, the categories have a natural order or ranking.\nThe distance or the the difference between the categories is not necessarily equal (i.e., the difference between the categories is not meaningful in a numerical sense).\nExamples of ordinal scale variables:\n\nEducational level (elementary, high school, college, and postgraduate).\nSocioeconomic status (low, middle, and high).\nPain severity (mild, moderate, and severe).\nCancer stage (stage I, stage II, stage III, and stage IV).\nLikert scale (strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, and strongly agree).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nConsider for example the variable pain severity, the difference between mild and moderate is not necessarily equal to the difference between moderate and severe.\nEven if we can code the categories as 1, 2, and 3, no mathematical operations can be performed on these numbers.\n\n\n\n\nInterval scale:\n\nIt is a quantitative scale.\nThe measurements are ordered (ranked).\nThe difference between measurements is meaningful (i.e., interpretable).\nIt does not have a true zero point (i.e., the value of zero does not indicate the absence of the quantity being measured). This zero point is arbitrary.\nThe ratio of two measurements is not meaningful because of the absence of a true zero point.\nExamples of interval scale variables:\n\nTemperature measured in Celsius or Fahrenheit.\nIntelligence Quotient (IQ) scores.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nConsider the temperature measured in Celsius, the difference between 10°C and 15°C is equal to the difference between 20°C and 25°C.\nHowever, the ratio of 20°C to 10°C is not meaningful (i.e., we can not say that 20°C is twice as hot as 10°).\nThe value of zero Celsius does not imply the absence of temperature (i.e., the absence of molecular kinetic energy).\n\n\n\n\nRatio scale:\n\nIt has the properties of the interval scale with the addition of:\n\nA true zero point.\nThe ratio of two measurements is meaningful.\n\nExamples of ratio scale variables:\n\nAge.\nWeight.\nTemperature measured in Kelvin (this scale has a true zero point).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nEach scale has the same properties as the scales that precede it.\nThe statistical analysis that can be performed on a lower scale variable can also be performed on a higher scale variable but the reverse is not true.\nThe scales can be ordered according to the level of information they provide in a descending order as follows: ratio &gt; interval &gt; ordinal &gt; nominal.\n\n\n\n\nExercise B.1.1 \n\n\nIndicate the measurement scale for each of the following variables:\n\nCar speed nominalordinalintervalratio\nCancer diagnosis nominalordinalintervalratio\nPain level on a 5-point scale nominalordinalintervalratio\nSerum sodium level nominalordinalintervalratio",

    "text": "2 Measures of central tendency\n\nMeasures of central tendency are used to describe the center of the data (i.e., the average or typical value).\nThey are also referred to as measures of location.\nThe most common measures of central tendency are the mean, median, and mode.\n\n\n2.1 Arithmetic Mean\n\nIt is calculated by summing all observations and dividing by the total number of observations.\nLet \\(X\\) is a random variable:\n\nThe mean of a finite population of size \\(N\\) is denoted by \\(\\mu\\), which reads as mu, while the mean of a sample of size \\(n\\) is denoted by \\(\\bar{x}\\), which reads as x-bar.\nThe population and sample means can be calculated as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopulation mean\nSample mean\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\mu = \\displaystyle \\frac{x_1 + x_2 + \\ldots + x_N}{N} = \\displaystyle     \\frac{\\displaystyle \\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i}{N}\\)\n\\(\\bar{x} = \\displaystyle \\frac{x_1 + x_2 + \\ldots + x_n}{n} = \\displaystyle \\frac{\\displaystyle \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n}\\)\n\n\n\n\nExample: consider the variable mpg in the mtcars dataset that we discussed in earlier chapters:\n\n\nClick to show/hide code\nmtcars$mpg\n\n\n [1] 21.0 21.0 22.8 21.4 18.7 18.1 14.3 24.4 22.8 19.2 17.8 16.4 17.3 15.2 10.4\n[16] 10.4 14.7 32.4 30.4 33.9 21.5 15.5 15.2 13.3 19.2 27.3 26.0 30.4 15.8 19.7\n[31] 15.0 21.4\n\n\n\nThe number of observations can be calculated using the length() function:\n\n\nClick to show/hide code\nlength(mtcars$mpg)\n\n\n[1] 32\n\n\nThe sum of all values can be calculated using the sum() function:\n\n\nClick to show/hide

built-in R function mean():\n\n\nClick to show/hide code\nmean(mtcars$mpg)\n\n\n[1] 20.09062\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nIf the variable contains missing values, the na.rm argument should be set to TRUE to exclude them before calculating the mean, otherwise, the result will be NA.\nFor example, consider the following variable with some missing values \\((1,\\ 2,\\ 3,\\ \\text{NA},\\ 5)\\):\n\nUsing the mean() function without the na.rm argument will return NA:\n\n\n\nClick to show/hide code\nx &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, NA, 5)\nmean(x)\n\n\n[1] NA\n\n\n\nThis error can be avoided by setting the na.rm argument to TRUE:\n\n\n\nClick to show/hide code\nmean(x, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n\n[1] 2.75\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mean can be calculated if the values are given along with their frequencies as weighted mean:\n\nLet \\(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_k\\) be the values of a variable with frequencies \\(f_1, f_2, \\ldots, f_k\\), then the weighted mean is calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\bar{x} = \\displaystyle \\frac{f_1x_1 + f_2x_2 + \\ldots + f_kx_k}{f_1 + f_2 + \\ldots + f_k} = \\displaystyle \\frac{\\displaystyle \\sum_{i=1}^{k} f_ix_i}{\\displaystyle \\sum_{i=1}^{k} f_i}\n\\]\n\nThe weight of each observation \\(\\displaystyle w_i =   \\frac{f_i}{\\displaystyle \\sum_{i=1}^{k} f_i}\\), therefore, the above equation can also be written as \\(\\bar{x} = \\displaystyle \\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_ix_i\\)\nExample: consider the following variable with values \\((1.3,\\ 2.1,\\ 3.5,\\ 4.1,\\ 5.2)\\) and frequencies \\((2,\\ 3,\\ 1,\\ 4,\\ 2)\\):\n\n\nClick to show/hide

my_data$Frequency)  # w represents the weights which can be given as frequencies or weights\n\n\n[1] 3.266667\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.1 Characteristics of the mean\n\nThe sum of deviations of the observations from the arithmetic mean is always zero:\n\n\\[\n\\displaystyle \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x}) = 0\n\\]\n\nThe sum of the squared deviations of the observations from a certain value is the least (i.e., minimized) when this value is the mean (this is referred to as the least squares principle).\nIf a constant \\(c\\) is added to each observation, the mean is also increased by \\(c\\), i.e., the mean of \\(x_i + c = \\bar{x} + c\\).\nIf the observations are multiplied by a constant \\(c\\), then the mean is also multiplied by \\(c\\), i.e., the mean of \\(cx_i = c\\bar{x}\\).\nIf the observations \\(x_1, x_2, \\ldots x_n\\) are linearly transformed, where \\(y_i = a + bx_i\\) (\\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are known constants), then it holds that \\(\\bar{y} = a + b\\bar{x}\\).\nThe mean is sensitive to extreme values (outliers), and it may not be a good measure of central tendency in the presence of outliers.\n\n\n\nListing 1: Impact of outliers on the mean\n\n\n\nExample: consider the following variable with values \\((32.1,\\ 34.5,\\ 33.6,\\ 37.2,\\ 39.4)\\) the mean is calculated as follows:\n\n\nClick to show/hide code\nx &lt;- c(32.1, 34.5, 33.6, 37.2, 39.4)\nmean(x)\n\n\n[1] 35.36\n\n\n\nLets replace the last value with an extreme value of \\(250.1\\), so the values would be:\n\n\nClick to show/hide code\nx[5] &lt;- 250.1\nx\n\n\n[1]  32.1  34.5  33.6  37.2 250.1\n\n\nThe mean of the new values with the outlier would be:\n\n\nClick to show/hide code\nmean(x)\n\n\n[1] 77.5\n\n\nThe presence of the outlier affected the mean that it is no longer a good measure of central tendency for this variable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2 Median\n\nThe median, denoted by \\(\\large \\tilde{x}_{0.5}\\), is the value which divides the ordered observations into two equal parts (i.e., at least 50% of the values \\(\\ge\\) the median and at least 50% of the values \\(\\le\\) the median).\nThe median is calculated as follows:\n\nIf the number of observations is odd, the median is the middle value of the ordered observations.\nIf the number of observations is even, the median is the arithmetic mean of the two middle observations.\n\n\n\\[\n\\tilde{x}_{0.5} = \\begin{cases} x_{\\frac{n+1}{2}} & \\text{if $n$ is odd} \\\\ \\\\ \\frac{1}{2}(x_{\\frac{n}{2}} + x_{\\frac{n}{2}+1}) & \\text{if $n$ is even} \\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nExample B.3.1 Example B.3.2 \n\n\n\nConsider the following set of observations: \\((3, 5, 7, 7, 7, 9, 11)\\).\n\nThere is an odd number of observations \\(n = 7\\), so the median is the middle value of the ordered observations, which is ranked \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{n+1}{2} = \\frac{7+1}{2}=4^{th}\\) and its value is \\(7\\).\nHalf of the measurements \\((3, 5, 7)\\) are below or equal to \\(7\\), and half of the measurements \\((7, 9, 11)\\) are equal to or above \\(7\\).\nTherefore, the previous defintion of the median contains “equal to” to cover the case of having repeated, similar values.\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: the variable mpg has \\(32\\) observations, so the median is the arithmetic mean of the two middle observations (i.e., the mean of the ordered observations ranked \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{32}{2} = 16^{th}\\) and \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{32}{2} + 1 =17^{th}\\)):\n\nThe ordered observations are:\n\n\nClick to show/hide code\nmpg_ordered &lt;-

code\nmedian(mtcars$mpg)\n\n\n[1] 19.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.1 Characteristics of the median\n\nUnlike the mean, the median is not drastically affected by extreme values (outliers).\nConsider the example discussed above Listing 1:\n\nThe median of the original set of observations is:\n\n\nClick to show/hide code\nmedian(c(32.1, 34.5, 33.6, 37.2, 39.4))\n\n\n[1] 34.5\n\n\nThe median of the set of observations with the outlier is:\n\n\nClick to show/hide code\nmedian(c(32.1, 34.5, 33.6, 37.2, 250.1))\n\n\n[1] 34.5\n\n\nBecuase the median is concerned with the middle value, it is less affected by the presence of the outliers than the mean.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3 Quantiles\n\nQuantiles are a generalization of of the concept of the median.\nA quantile is defined as the value that divides the ordered observations into two parts such that a certain proportion of the observations are less than or equal to the quantile.\nIn this sense, the median is the \\(50^{th}\\) quantile because at least \\(50\\%\\) of the observations are less than or equal to the median.\nSimilarly, the \\(20^{th}\\) quantile is the value that divides the ordered observations into two parts such that at least \\(20\\%\\) of the observations are less than or equal to the that quantile, while at least \\(80\\%\\) of the observations are greater than or equal to that quantile.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral definition of quantiles\n\n\n\n\nLet \\(\\alpha\\) be a number between \\(0\\) and \\(1\\).\nThe \\([(\\alpha \\times 100)\\%\\) quantile is denoted by \\(\\large \\tilde{x}_{\\alpha}\\).\nIt is defined as the value that splits the data into two parts such that at least \\(\\alpha \\times 100\\%\\) of the observations are less than or equal to the quantile, while at least \\((1 - \\alpha) \\times 100\\%\\) of the observations are greater than or equal to the quantile.\n\n\n\n\nDeciles divide the data into \\(10\\) parts, corresponding to quantiles at \\(\\alpha = 0.1, 0.2, \\ldots, 0.9\\).\nQuintiles divide the data into \\(5\\) parts, corresponding to quantiles at \\(\\alpha = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8\\).\nQuartiles divide the data into \\(4\\) parts, corresponding to quantiles at \\(\\alpha = 0.25, 0.5, 0.75\\).\nPercentiles: if \\((\\alpha \\times 100)\\) takes an integer value, the quantile is referred to as a percentile (i.e, divide the data into \\(100\\) equal parts).\n\n\n2.3.1 Calculation of quantiles\n\nThe quantiles can be obtained in R using the quantile() function.\nFor example, the quantiles of the variable mpg in the mtcars dataset can be calculated as follows:\n\n\nClick to show/hide code\nquantile(mtcars$mpg)\n\n\n    0%    25%    50%    75%   100% \n10.400 15.425 19.200 22.800 33.900 \n\n\nBy default, The function outputs the \\(0^{th}\\),

it becomes cluttered and hard to read when the number of categories is large.\nIf the number of observations is small, it is recommended to display the absolute frequency on the chart rather than the percentage, which can be misleading.\n\nBase RUsing ggplot2\n\n\n\n\nClick to show/hide code\n# extract the relative frequencies from the data frame created above\npercentages &lt;- freq_tbl_df$rel_freq\n\n# create labels with the percentages\nlabels &lt;- \n  paste0(c(\"V-shaped\", \"Straight\"), \n         \"\\n\", \n         percentages, \n         \"%\"\n  )\n\n# create a pie chart \npie(\n freq_tbl,\n main = \"Pie chart of the Engine Type\",\n col = c(\"skyblue\", \"lightgreen\"),\n labels = labels,  # Use the percentage labels\n clockwise = TRUE\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to show/hide code\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggthemes)\n\nggplot(\n  freq_tbl_df,\n  aes(\n    x = \"\",\n    y = rel_freq,\n    fill = engine_type\n  )\n) +\ngeom_bar(\n  stat = \"identity\",\n  width = 1\n) +\ncoord_polar(\"y\", start = 0) +\nlabs(\n  title = \"Pie chart of the Engine Type\",\n  fill = \"Engine Type\"\n) +\nscale_fill_manual(\n  values = c(\"skyblue\", \"lightgreen\")\n) +\ntheme_void() +\ntheme(\n  legend.position = \"none\", \n  plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)\n) +\ngeom_text(\n  aes(label = labels),\n  position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5)\n)",
